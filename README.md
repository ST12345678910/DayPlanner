# DayPlanner
 
 A simple calender application that allows a user to save unique events 
 for each hour of their work day. Any text that the user inputs into the
 text area, will be saved to localStorage upon pressing the save button to
 the right. This allows for the user to continuously refresh, open, and
 close the page while still leaving their events in the calender. The
 application relies on the use of the **MomentJS** library for accurate
 time, **jQuery** for simplification of the JavaScript, and **notify.js**
 for notifications.
